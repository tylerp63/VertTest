## Description

This project aims to assist volleyball players in understanding and improving their jumping capabilities. By utilizing Python and OpenCV, we're able to track a player's motion, calculate jump height in real-time, and display this data directly on the video feed.

## Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Get instant feedback on your jumps.
- **High Score Tracking**: Keeps a record of the maximum jump height achieved during a session.
- **Calibration**: Ability to calibrate the system to translate pixel units to real-world measurements.
- **Optimized Tracking**: Focuses on the main subject, ensuring precise jump height measurement.
